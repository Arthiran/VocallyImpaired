This game was made for the Ludwig game jam where the theme was based off Foddian games.

The idea was to create a game with a unique mechanic (Voice Controls), paired with level design to create a game which emulates the mentioned games.

Please make sure you have a working microphone and speak clearly.

Thank you for playing, I hope you enjoy!
